messages with devices is great. As I tried to explain in the last blog post about\nthe cloud side of things, having a modular system, and\nnormalizing the transport protocol can make things a lot easier. However, exchanging messages is only the first\nstep towards an IoT application.\nBlinkedy blink\nMaybe you noticed, maybe not … but Rodney blinks, every now and then. Just like devices send data, every now and then.\nAnd it is easy for devices to implement that. A change happens, message sent. That's it.\nHowever, on the consuming side of those changes, receiving the information of a change is equally important as the\ncurrent state of the device. Or maybe event group of devices.\nJust to visualize what I mean. I bet you did take a look Rodney a few seconds back. What you saw, was:\n\nNow you are the process, consuming on the cloud side, and the image is the overall state of your device. You expect\nthe see the full picture, literally. Just assume what it would look like, not having the previous state, only the\nchanges:\n\nIt would start out blank, because you never had the initial state. Then, it would change, but the change itself doesn't\nmake any sense. Neither would the change back.\nFor the device, it would be convenient tough, to only the most recent change. For the network that would be easier to\nhandle as well, as it means less data.\nHowever, for the consuming side, it would be harder to process. Because the information about the current state is\nnot easily available.\nCurrent state\nLet's take a simple dashboard as an example, showing the most recent temperate value. That is easy to implement with\nour current example application. The most recent state of that sensor is always available in our time series database.\nAssuming a more complex example, of a more complex device, with much more data. We cannot push everything into a\ntime series database. That would take up too much space and would also be not feasible for some of the data formats.\nSo we do need some kind of storage, which persists the last known state of a device. And you need a way to keep\nthe data fresh.\nDigital Twin\nThis is where the concept of a digital twin comes into play. Taking a look at Wikipedia:\n\nA digital twin is a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity\n\nThis is what many use cases require on the IoT application side. To have a digital representation of your device, \nideally with some magic that keeps the data fresh, providing easy access to it.\nAn important part of this is to know the data structure of your device/entity. In most cases you will have a\nbigger, overall data structure. However, you cannot always transmit the full set of information when changes occur.\nThat is why you need to transmit deltas, in order to keep traffic low. Digital twins help you to structure your device\ndata, and with that, allow you to more easily implement delta\nupdates.\nBut wait, there is more\nDelta update is one aspect a digital twin can help with. With a structured data model, you can also start to\nnormalize data. Maybe define what sensors you have, what actuators, what state they provide, and what operations\nthey can perform. This would allow you to map your different payload structures into re-usable schemas, and re-use\ncode that works with the data as well.\nHaving a structured data model would of course also allow for providing a structured API for your devices. Making it\neasy to interact with them from the cloud side. It also allows to introspec devices, and let users explore devices\ncapabilities.\nBased on a formal device model, it would also be possible to create some tooling around that. For example in the area\nof visualization and mapping. \nHow do we get there?\nSo ideally we would need a way to describe device's data models, a system to store the information in these structures,\na way to interact with that data in a structured way, and an easy way to translate between our device's payload formats\nand the defined models.\nLet's take a look at Eclipse Vorto and Eclipse Ditto.\nVorto describes itself as:\n\nLanguage for Digital Twins\n\nAnd Ditto:\n\n… where IoT devices and their digital twins get together\n\nSounds like a perfect match. No wonder, both communities work together closely, in order to implement a digital twin\nsolution.\nAn example\nSo, let's try integrating this into our cloud side deployment. Currently, our example temperature sensor posts\nJSON snippets like this:\n{ \"temp\": 1.23 }\n\nVery simple and easy to handle. If we would describe this as a Vorto model, this could look like this:\nvortolang 1.0\nnamespace io.drogue.demo\nversion 1.0.0\ndisplayname \"FirstTestDevice\"\ndescription \"Information Model for FirstTestDevice\"\n\nusing org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor.TemperatureSensor ; 1.0.0\n\ninfomodel FirstTestDevice {\n\n\tfunctionblocks {\n\t    mandatory temperature as TemperatureSensor\n\t}\n\n}\n\nMore verbose, true. However, we also get a bunch of features with that. Like versioning, referencing existing data types,\nvalidation, etc. As you can see, we are not defining our own temperature sensor, but already re-use a standard Vorto\nmodel for that: org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor.TemperatureSensor.\nThe public Vorto repository already contains a bunch of models. Like the code that runs the\nrepository, the models can be open source as well. Of course, you can also host how own instance, if that is what\nyou need. But let's re-use the public instance for your example. Our model is published as\nio.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0.\nIf you have deployed the digital twin\ncomponent from drogue-cloud, then you can create a new device in the\nDitto repository like this:\n\n\nExport the device model from the public repository:\nMODEL_ID=io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0\nhttp -do FirstTestDevice.json https://vorto.eclipse.org/api/v1/generators/eclipseditto/models/$MODEL_ID/?target=thingJson\n\n\nCreate a new device in Ditto, based on this model:\nDEVICE_ID=my:dev1\nTWIN_API=\"https://ditto:ditto@ditto-console-drogue-iot.apps.my.cluster\"\n\ncat FirstTestDevice.json | http PUT \"$TWIN_API/api/2/things/$DEVICE_ID\"\n\n\nNow the Ditto instance is ready to receive updates for this device, in the Ditto Protocol JSON format.\nMapping data\nOne feature of the Vorto repository is, that it can help you create a mapping model for your device model:\n\nYou provide some example data from your device, and fill in expression where to find that data. You can even test the\nmapping directly and check the results.\nOnce you have created the mapping, we need to inject this into our event processing. Now, the modularity and\nflexibility of Knative come into play.\nLet's assume we pull events from a Kafka source:\napiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1\nkind: KafkaSource\nmetadata:\n  name: digital-twin-kafka-source\nspec:\n  consumerGroup: digital-twin\n  bootstrapServers:\n    - kafka-eventing-kafka-bootstrap.knative-eventing.svc:9092\n  topics:\n    - knative-messaging-kafka.drogue-iot.iot-channel\n  sink:\n    ref:\n      apiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Sequence\n      name: digital-twin\n\nForward it to the following sequence:\napiVersion: flows.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Sequence\nmetadata:\n  name: digital-twin\nspec:\n  channelTemplate:\n    …\n  steps:\n  - ref:\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      kind: Service\n      name: vorto-converter\n      namespace: drogue-iot\n  reply:\n    ref:\n      kind: Service\n      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\n      name: ditto-pusher\n\nThe vorto-converter being a Knative service defined as:\napiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: vorto-converter\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - image: ghcr.io/drogue-iot/vorto-converter:0.1.1\n\nThen that would consume the original device payload from a Kafka topic, and look up the data mapper in the Vorto\nrepository, based on a cloud events extension, containing the model id. The converter is a simple Knative service,\nbased on Quarkus, and can be scaled up as required. The result of this would look like:\n{\n  \"headers\":{\n    \"response-required\":false\n  },\n  \"path\":\"/features\",\n  \"topic\":\"my/dev1/things/twin/commands/modify\",\n  \"value\":{\n    \"temperature\":{\n      \"definition\":[\n        \"org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0\"\n      ],\n      \"properties\":{\n        \"status\":{\n          \"value\": 1.23\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAs you can see from the \"modify\" command, this is already intended to partially update the model, based on the\nnew information. The result would look like:\n{\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"modelDisplayName\": \"FirstTestDevice\"\n    },\n    \"definition\": \"io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0\",\n    \"features\": {\n        \"temperature\": {\n            \"definition\": [\n                \"org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"status\": {\n                    \"value\": 1.23\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"policyId\": \"my:dev1\",\n    \"thingId\": \"my:dev1\"\n}\n\nAs it is a simple model, with only one status value, it doesn't look that different, but I hope you get the idea.\nDeveloping\nGetting the status of a device is easy now. A simple HTTP call is sufficient, and we can get the most recent device\nstate, including all information that our device supports. We have a structured data model, which we can use to build\ntooling and application on, which helps us validate and map the payload that comes from our devices.\nAdditionally, we can also start to search for things like \"all sensors reporting 5 °C or more\", with\na query like: ge(features/temperature/properties/status/value,5.0). So not only can we store device state,\nwe can also use it to find devices, based on their current state.\nWhat's next\nI hope I was able to explain a bit, why the initial overhead of setting up a system like this makes sens, and what\nthe benefits are. To be fair, Knative helps lot getting this deployed on your Kubernetes cluster.\nThere is a lot more you can do with Digital Twins, reconciling desired vs actual state for example. But, I will\nleave that for a future blog post.\nSee also\n\ndrogue-cloud repository\nEclipse Ditto \nEclipse Vorto\nPublic Vorto instance\ndrogue-vorto-converter repository\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/digital-twins/","title":"Digital Twins, and how they can help"},"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/":{"body":"Getting started with an ESP-01 isn't one of the easiest\nthings. At least if you are not used to embedded systems. It is a nice solution though to add Wi-Fi\ncapabilities to an existing platform.\nThe ESP-01\nI started out with my STM32F723E-DISCOVERY board,\nand choose it simply because it provides a nice set of interfaces. Which is great for testing and, well, discovering.\nWhat it doesn't have, is on-board Wi-Fi, or any other kind of network support. Not ideal if you plan on doing IoT.\nHowever, brings a ready-to-plug ESP-01 port, which is mapped to an internal UART. That port is specifically designed\nfor the ESP-01. It has a matching slot, with the correct pin assignment, the required 3.3V, and maps to UART5 on the\nboard.\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nMy naive idea, was to simply plug it in, and \"dial out\" to the internet with some\nAT commands. The\nESP chips provide an out-of-the-box firmware, which offers you a set of \"AT commands\", that control the Wi-Fi and\nTCP/IP stack, which is embedded in the chip. You only need some serial communication, and let the chip handle the more\ncomplex things.\nFirmware updates\nBefore ordering, I already read that the shipped firmware of some ESPs, is most likely extremely old. And indeed,\nthat was the case for me as well. I had hoped for something more recent, but I had no luck.\nPlaying with some NodeMCU like boards, which feature the same ESP8622 chip, I know that you can easily flash a new\nfirmware using the esptool.py from the command line. All you need is a PC and a USB cable. The problem is, the ESP-01\ndoesn't have a USB port. In the case of the NodeMCU, you have an UART interface built into the board, which connects\nthe USB port with the ESP. On the USB host, you simply see it as a UART USB interface.\nAs the ESP-01 requires 3.3V, instead of the 5V that most other UARTs require, you do need to come up with some extra\nwiring. There are a lot of tutorials on the net,\nwhich explain how to flash an ESP-01. I guess, the simplest solution is to buy and FTDI adapter, which supports 3.3V.\nHowever, even that still requires you to come up with a solution for triggering the programming mode of the ESP via\nthe GPIO0 port.\nThe solution\nOn the other side, right on my desk was the discovery board, which has support for the ESP-01 out of the box. It also\nhas an internal \"virtual com port\", which is connected through USB with the host over the ST-LINK port. On the board it\nis known as USART6, and on my Linux machine, it becomes /dev/ttyACM0.\nThe only thing required was a \"proxy\", which bridges the two serial ports. A few lines of Rust later, I came up with\na rather simple loop, which looked something like this:\nloop {\n   if let Ok(c) = rx_esp.read() {\n      to_vcom.push(c);\n   }\n   if let Ok(c) = rx_vcom.read() {\n      to_esp.push(c);\n   }\n   if let Some(to_esp.peek()) {\n      if let Ok(_) = tx_esp.write() {\n         to_esp.poll();\n      }\n   }\n   if let Some(to_vcom.peek()) {\n      if let Ok(_) = tx_vcom.write() {\n         tx_vcom.poll();\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nTo be fair, my code doesn't look as elegant as this. You can take a peek at\nctron/embedded-serial-bridge. However, it isn't too difficult either.\nI think Rust helps you a lot to write readable code, even in the context of embedded devices. \nPlugging in the discovery board now provides a USB serial interface. Depending on the mode I select, the ESP gets\nbooted either in normal mode or in programming mode. In the programming mode, I can use the esptool now to\nflash the ESP-01. Or recover from a bricked device. In normal mode, I can use minicom,\nto play with AT commands. \nLessons learned\nWas that really necessary? It was a good opportunity to learn about embedded and Rust. As mentioned before, I could\nhave bought an FTDI adapter, and try to get away with that. On the other side, building that serial bridge with Rust\nand cargo embed, was quite easy.\nA problem that I faced during development, was that I lost quite a number of characters at some point.\nMy assumption was, that although I did not use DMA and interrupts, the loop should be fast enough to\nprocess a few characters.\nIt took me a while until I figured out, that this was caused by the Rust debug code. The more complex my program got,\nthe more characters I did loose. Building in release mode with cargo embed --release fixed the issue.\nFuture improvements\nMy itch is scratched. On the other side, I am pretty sure I will need to flash some ESP-01 in the future. So maybe\nI will make my own life easier and make use of the user button that the ESP has. It could be used top reset the ESP\nafter flashing. Or switch the modes between programming and normal mode. The LEDs could be use, to show serial traffic,\nor in which mode the system is.\nIt could also be fun, to port this to a different board. Right now the code is specifically written for the STM32F723IE.\nThe Rust build support features, which allow you to do conditional compilation and dependencies. The good thing\nwith Rust's conditional compilation is, that all the guarantees that Rust gives, you are still valid. So it should\nbe possible to allow you to compile for a specific board, like this:\ncargo embed --feature &lt;your board&gt;\n\nAnd maybe, if you have the some problem, this gives you a reason to try it out yourself.\nSee also\n\nGitHub repository — https://github.com/ctron/embedded-serial-bridge\nCargo embed — https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-embed\nRust/Cargo Features — https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/","title":"Creating an ESP programmer"},"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/":{"body":"There's a lot of variety in the embedded world. \nWhile we've implemented the ESP8266 WiFi-offload board over USART last time, now we're doing the Inventek eS-WiFi over the SPI bus.\nLet's explore some of the differences.\neS-WiFi\nThe reason we're addressing this WiFi-offload board is because it's what ships on the STM B-L4S5I-IOT01A board.\nRadio-related peripherals are often sold as complete units and soldered onto another board, instead of built natively onto the main board from components.\nThis assists with certifications from the FCC and other bodies that care about the signals you're emitting.\n\nAs with the ESP8266, it ostensibly uses Hayes AT commands to communicate.\nUnlike the ESP8266, the eS-WiFi, at least when mounted by STM onto this devboard, uses SPI as it's interface.\nSPI\nSPI is a unique little beast. \nIt's a bus, which allows multiple peripherals to be attached at a time.\nYou may see abbreviations such as MISO and MOSI, but given sensitivity of the underlying words and how they affect others, we're moving to using CIPO and COPI.\nCIPO stands for Controller In, Peripheral Out, which COPI stands for Controller Out, Peripheral In.\nTwo wires; one heads each direction.\nAdditionally, there's a SCK wire, which provides a clock (driven by the controller), so there is no need to agree a-priori on the communication speed.\n(This assumes the peripheral can keep up with the speed set by the controller).\nCompare to USARTs, where both sides have to agree, out-of-band, on the baudrate, etc.\nWith multiple peripherals on the bus, the way each peripheral is given a chance to talk to the controller is through a chip select (CS) pin.\nIn general, the controller dedicates one pin per peripheral. These pins are active low, so that to signal a chip is selected, the pin should be brought down to ground.\nThis also means you need either an internal or external pull-up resistor so that when the peripheral is not selected, it's seeing a positive voltage on its end of the CS wire.\nGiven that there are two roles (controller and peripheral), this indicates that any communication that occurs is at the behest and control of the controller, hence it's name and role.\nPeriphals cannot just random start transmitting. \nThe controller will lower a given a peripheral's CS pin to signal that communications is desired with it.\nAnd then things get weird.\nEven when selected, the peripheral doesn't drive the clock (SCK), so it still can't communicate.\nInstead, the bus works with simultaneous bi-direction communication, driven by the controller.\nFor every byte the controller sends, the peripheral sends a byte.\nOf course, on the face of it, this makes it seem like the controller and peripheral both shout at each other for the same amount of time.\nIn reality, the controller may communicate something (like a request) to the peripheral, and ignore the junk that the peripheral is shouting back at the same time.\nThen, in order to receive a response that includes useful content, the controller will continue to send additional junk to the peripheral (which it ignores) so that it can swap bytes back to the controller.\nThis is sometimes referred to \"clocking out bytes\". The bytes sent by the control in this mode are pretty meaningless, other than defining the clock pulses that the peripheral can use to return data.\nHow does the controller know how much junk to send to give the peripheral a chance to fully reply?\nIn some cases, the on-the-wire protocol may define, thought a reference document, how many bytes to expect. Or the protocol may involve some number of bytes which encode a length of the remainder of the payload.\nIn the case of the eS-WiFi board, there yet another pin, the ready pin, which is controlled by the peripheral.\nAs long as the peripheral keeps that pin high, the controller continues to transmit junk, and gather the response bytes from the peripheral.\nOnce that pin goes low, the controller can stop pumping out junk bytes and know it has the entire response.\nWord up.\nThe HAL for the STM32L4 implements a 8-bit-word-based SPI interface.\nThe eS-WiFi board uses 16-bit words (or roughly... 2 bytes).\nUnfortunately, a 16-bit word is not exactly a straight-line array of two 8-bit bytes.\nReading bytes\nThe eS-Wifi communication involves swapping bytes, if you read in two 8-bit bytes in at a time.\nAnd to read bytes, you have to transmit junk, but in this case, very specific junk: newline bytes.\nHere, we transmit 2 newlines, and the SPI will replace those two characters with two bytes of the peripheral's response (which it actually sent as a single 16-bit word):\nlet mut xfer: [u8; 2] = [0x0A, 0x0A];\nlet result = self.spi.transfer(&amp;mut xfer);\n\nGiven the 8-vs-16 bit wordsize and byte-swapping, we have to read the array backwards.\nThe data should be interpreted in this order:\nlet buffer: [u8;2 ] = [ xfer[1], xfer[0] ]\n\nIf, by chance, we were working with larger arrays of transfers, we'd have to read each pairwise set of bytes in swapped order.\nIn an 8-array, we'd have to interpret the data using indices: 1 0 3 2 5 4 7 and then 6.\nThe eS-WiFi will also send an 0x15 (nak) if it doesn't want to transmit an even number of bytes, as padding.\nWriting bytes\nJust as with reading, the controller has to deal with byte-swapping and padding, but in this case, we must pad with 0x0A (newline) if we don't have an even number of bytes.\nfor chunk in command.chunks(2) {\n    let mut xfer: [u8; 2] = [0; 2];\n    xfer[1] = chunk[0];\n    if chunk.len() == 2 {\n        xfer[0] = chunk[1]\n    } else {\n        xfer[0] = 0x0A\n    }\n\n    let result = self.spi.transfer(&amp;mut xfer);\n\n    ...\n}\n\nEffectively, if we wanted to transmit ['b', 'o', 'b'], we would have to transmit two 2-byte arrays shaped like:\n[ 'o', 'b' ]\n[ '\\n', 'b' ]\n\nOr as a 4-array: [ 'o', 'b', '\\n', 'b']\nFun, yeah?\nBut now you can TCP\nOf course, all of this gets hidden, as it's implementation details for the driver.\nSee the drogue-es-wifi crate's README for details on how to use it to actually do some TCP connections.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/","title":"eS-WiFi and SPI"},"https://blog.drogue.io/first-steps-in-iot/":{"body":"Welcome to the Drogue IoT blog. This is where I intend to document \nmy progress through discovering how to build enterprise-grade IoT device\nsystems using Rust and ARM Cortex-M MCUs.\nIntroduction\nI'm coming from a background of enterprise Java development, where things\ncan easily be rebooted, debugged, and 16gb of heap can easily be garbage-collected.\nI also have virtually no experience with hardware and electronics.\nAs you can imagine, this journey will be full of frustrations and missteps.\nLet's begin!\nStatus Quo\nThe first project I'm working on, mostly as a way to learn new things, involves\nreplacing a project I've already built before once: Mr Weathery.  Mr Weathery\nis built using the Particle.io cloud and Arduino-like devices, plus a Raspberry Pi\n3B+ sitting in corner. \nThe Pi runs a node.js application that periodically polls the Netatmo weather \ncloud for data from my local weather sensors. It'd also poll the DarkSky APIs for weather\nforecasts. It would then put all of this information on the Particle.io message bus.\nThe first Particle.io device has both WiFi and BLE on-board, and running stock firmware\nit simple acts as a bridge from the IP-based Particle cloud to my main Particle.io board that\nonly speaks BLE, which consumes all of the abovementioned data.\nThe BLE-only board drives an e-paper display to handily show the current and forecast\nweather conditions.\n\nThat's 3 boards, 2 clouds, and a 1 third-party API involved to simply tell me it's raining,\nor will be raining tomorrow. Given the machinations around some of these vendors, \nI realized I should reformulate how Mr Weathery works.\nPlus, given it's a known problem domain with at least one known solution to me,\nI can concentrate on the implementation, not on the specification and design.\nThe New Plan\nWhen originally designed, Mr Weathery was intended to be battery-powered, hence the\nusage of the BLE board.  In reality, he's always plugged into the power mains, so the\nlow-power requirement is less important. \nIf the display can also have consistent power, he can also perform all of the HTTP-over-WiFi \ndancing directly. That would allow me to remove both the Raspberry Pi and the \nWiFi-to-BLE bridge to produce a standalone device.\nInstead of programming an Arduino-like device using C, I'm moving to an \nSTM32 ARM Cortex-M\nchip to power it, using Rust. This is quite the change for me. So far I quite enjoy Rust,\nand the Cortex-M is a nice 32bit processor with more power than many Arduino-like boards.\nThe downside, thus far, is that the STM32s don't have WiFi on-board. While I could adapter boards\nor shields to a dev-kit, I'd ultimately like to fabricate a custom board around the MCU and\nuse a simpler/smaller pre-certified WiFi module.\nGiven I have a bag of Espressif ESP8266 modules handy, \nI'm approaching it as my WiFi adapter.\n\nFor the time-being, I'm using an STM32F401RE development board \nrunning at 84mhz for building the software. It has the benefit of having a USB port with ST-Link on-board\nfor easily flashing and debugging the code.\nBecause Nothing is Easy\nOf course, nothing ever is easy.\nThe ESP8266 is available through the USART \non the STM32. It's fairly simple to wire\nup, and it communicates with Hayes AT commands to enumerate available WiFi access points,\njoin a network, open sockets and communicate.  The AT commands are pretty well documented,\nbut I discovered my bag of ESP8266 were flashed with firmware in... 2016.  And they don't\nmatch the current capabilities documented by Espressif. \nThe ESP8266 runs an Xtensa chip, which is not currently supported by embedded Rust on the \nmainline, and frankly, writing software directly for the ESP8266 would be an effort in \nYak-shaving, so I simply need to update its stock firmware to a newer version.\nWhile people speak of \"ESP8266\" as a thing, it's actually many things, with varying amount \nof memory on-board. Mine has 1mb. Espressif has had varying degrees of diligence in producing\nfirmware versions that fit the various sizes of ESPs. Thankfully, a repository exists with\na slightly improved build/flash situation to target whatever size ESP you might have:\nESP8266_AT_LoBo GitHub Repository\nThis repository is definitely Linux-centric, but a few edits to the various scripts, and\nit runs will enough on OSX to work.\nTo flash an ESP8266, you need a serial port on your machine, which is provided using\nan FTDI adapter. \nThe FTDI converts a USB port into a few pins of serial port, and also \nprovides 3.3v or 5v of power. There are many warnings on the interwebs that the current \nthey provide is not enough to actually power an ESP during flash or usage.\nTo overcome this potential problem, I'm powering the ESP through a breadboard 3.3v \npower supply.\n\nStay Grounded\nWhile attempting to use the ESP through a serial terminal (because it should operate\nlike your old USRobotics 14.4k Dual Standard modem you used to connect to FidoNet...)\nI was finding a ton of noise, and it didn't work. \nLesson #1: All grounds must be tied together.\nEven if you're not using the power from the FTDI, its ground pin needs to be connected\nto the same ground pin the ESP uses. Serial USART works in relation to a common reference \nvoltage (GND), and if two devices have different concepts of ground, it's just not going to work.\nDon't trust your tools\nUsing the flashing scripts from LoBo, everything appeared successful, yet my device\nkept coming up non-funcitonal. Turns out there are several flash modes for ESPs, and\nthe esptool.py doesn't actually really verify if flashing was successful in terms of\nbeing actually successful. Rather, it just seems to think it successfully sent bytes\ndown the wire.\nLesson #2: Try all variants until you find the one that works.\nIn my case, for my ESP8266, I had to use a flash-mode of dout. \nBack to making progress\nmurray:esp8266-tcp bob$ miniterm.py /dev/tty.usbserial-AB0JSKDU 115200\n--- Miniterm on /dev/tty.usbserial-AB0JSKDU  115200,8,N,1 ---\n--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T

IoT"},"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/":{"body":"In the embedded world, quite often you don't have a wall clock sort of clock. \nYou may have something that can reckon the passage of time, though. \nThe various current solutions for managing time within embedded Rust has yet to be completely abstracted.\nWe leverage some up-and-coming libraries to help paper over the differences.\nTime keeps on slipping... into the future...\nWhen you're doing embedded Rust, sometimes you want to know how much time has passed, and sometimes you want to pause for some amount of time.\nThe embedded-hal provides two useful types of traits:\n\nDelays\nTimers\n\nA delay provides a blocking operation which pauses execution for some amount of time.\nA timer allows you to know when some amount of time has elapsed.\nAt least using my current board, based on the STM32L4 family, the HAL provides exactly 1 delay, but a large handful of timers.\nWhy is this important?\nI'm trying to interface over SPI to yet-another WiFi-offload board.\nThis board, like many, needs certain pins raised and lowered. \nIt also needs you to wait a few milliseconds after raising or lowering the pin before you assume the board has dealt with the change.\nRoughly:\n\nLower pin, signalling you are about to send some data.\nWait 10 milliseconds.\nSend some data.\nRaise the pin signalling you are done sending data.\n\nOne Delay, Multiple Timers\nAs noted, often you might find yourself in an environment that only has one available Delay.\nAnd if your environment is RTIC, the framework itself may take the delay facilities for its own software task scheduling, leaving you with zero.\nAdd to that multiple drivers that need to be able to delay every now and then, and you find yourself in a precarious situation.\nNo unified concept of time\nThe various HALs may define their own time structures, their timers might work in terms of milliseconds or hertz, and in general\nit's quite difficult to write any device driver that can have assurances of how time is managed and recorded.\nEnter embedded-time and drogue-embedded-timer\nembedded-time\nPeter Taylor has been trying to create a unified view of time for the embedded world, suitable called embedded-time.\nIt provides everything you could hope for in terms of units-of-time, duration and instance measurements, and conversions into/from rates.\nIt does not provide bindings to hardware.\ndrogue-embedded-timer\nThe drogue-embedded-timer library attempts to provide directly-usable bindings of\nPeter's embedded-time library to the embedded Rust HAL-centric world.\nClocks\nAt the bottom of the stack is an embedded-time Clock, which is a software device to measure the passage of time.\nIt may have an arbitrary amount of precision, marking off individual microseconds, dozens of milliseconds, or entire seconds at each tick.\nTimers (and Delays)\nOnce you have a clock that you can watch, you can then define a Timer which is capable of measuring some specific duration of time, according to that clock.\nIf you make that timer pause until the duration of time has passed, you have yourself a Delay.\nBuild the Clock\nAs noted above, the clock can have whatever precision makes sense in your application. \nIf you need millisecond precision, you tick the clock every 1 millisecond.\nIf you need less precision, maybe you tick it every 500 milliseconds, saving yourself some power along the way.\nIf you have the need for multiple different precision clocks (one ticking microseconds while another ticks away seconds), that's also quite possible.\nCreating the clock is as easy as defining a static Clock of the precision you need.\nThe drogue-embedded-timer library has a variety of different clocks set up for a variety of different precisions.\nLet's use a clock with 100ms precision:\nuse drogue_embedded_timer::MillisecondsClock100;\n\nstatic CLOCK: MillisecondsClock100 = MillisecondsClock100::new();\nMake the Clock tick.\nOkay, we have a clock, but it's just sitting there, frozen in time.\nThankfully, the clock can provide an external remote-control that will tick it forward (100ms in this case) every time you push the button.\nThe easiest way to push the button on a regular basis is using your HAL's timers and their associated interrupts.\nSo on my board, the first thing I do is use TIM15 and set it up to timeout every 100ms, so that it has a known rhythm that matches my CLOCK defined above:\nlet mut tim15 = Timer::tim15(device.TIM15, 100, clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\nI enable the interrupt so that it fires ever time the timeout occurs, giving me a chance to push the button and advance my CLOCK ahead one 100ms tick:\ntim15.listen(Event::TimeOut);\n\nSince each HAL does things possibly differently, but we know an interrupt must be cleared once it's handled, you're able to provide a callback that will be executed for each tick, to give you a chance to do just that.\nThe callback is actually in the form of an opaque object (usually your TIM* timer object), and a closure that can use that object.\nOn my current board, I'm using the TIM15 timer, and I have to call timer.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut) each time the ISR is invoked.\nTherefore, we need to pass that information to the CLOCK when we ask to get the ticker for it:\nlet ticker = CLOCK.ticker(tim15, \n                          (|t| { t.clear_interrupt(Event::TimeOut); }) as fn(&amp;mut Timer&lt;TIM15&gt;));\n\nAll that's left now is to actually wire up the interrupt handler to the TIM15 interrupt.\nUsing RTIC, I bind a task to it. I've also put the ticker into the shared resources so my ISR can access it.\ninit::LateResources {\n    ticker,\n    ...\n}\n#[task(binds = TIM15, priority = 15, resources = [ticker])]\nfn ticker(mut ctx: ticker::Context) {\n    ctx.resources.ticker.tick();\n}\n\nI make sure the priority of this ISR is pretty high, because I don't want my clock to slow down if the system is also under load doing other thing.\nAt this point, time is flowing forward.\nTimers &amp; Delays\nNow the CLOCK static is a bonafide embedded-time Clock implementation, and can do all the things Peter's APIs allow you to do.\nYou can create an embedded-time Timer and use it however you like:\n// Create a 10 second timer\nlet timer = embedded_time::Timer::new(&amp;CLOCK, Seconds(10u32));\n\n// Start the timer\nlet timer = timer.start().unwrap();\n\n// Wait for 10 seconds to expire (blocking)\ntimer.wait().unwrap();\n\nOur use-case from the very top of this article, though, is being able to block for a little while.\nThe embedded-hal provide two blocking Delay implementations.\ndrogue-embedded-timer doesn't rely on embedded-hal so we provide an alternative Delay implementation, which is embedded-time-native.\n// Construct a new Delay\nlet mut delay = CLOCK.delay();\n\n// Delay for 4 seconds (blocking)\ndelay.delay(Seconds(4u32));\n\n// Delay for 4000 milliseconds (blocking)\ndelay.delay(Milliseconds(4000u32));\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that your delay will always be at least as long as the precision of your clock.\nSince we created a clock with 100 milliseconds of precision (1/10th of a second), our delay can be no shorter than that.\nMath also tells us our delay could end up being a hair less than twice the precision, depending on how long you're attempting to delay.\nIt's wise to ensure the precision is half the time of your average delay.\nFor instance, if you want to delay for 10 milliseconds, you should probably create a clock with a 5 millisecond precision.\nConclusion\nWith a unified and abstracted way to consider time, timers and delays, device-drivers that need to understand time can be written more generically.\nIt also means less shimming of your board-specific timers into whatever format your driver might want.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/","title":"It's a Matter of Time"},"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/":{"body":"Non-technical post -- Hey, we have a new logo!\nFirst, what is a \"drogue\"?\nThe word \"drogue\" has several meanings. \nIt's French for \"drug\" which is probably not the best connotation.\nThe flunkies in A Clockwork Orange were called \"droogs\" which is also not great.\nBut there's also a storm drogue which is used to add stability to vessels in the sea.\n\nWho is Rodney?\nRodney is a garden gnome my niece left in our yard a few years ago. \nHe's adorable and keeps watch over the chickens and the other goings-on in the yard.\n\nHis hat seems rather storm drogue-shaped. \nAnd the new identity\nFor projects, I have started to prefer logos that are actually mascots. \nThey just seem more personable.\nThanks to our handy-dandy designer James Cobb, we\nnow have a logo-fied version of Rodney the gnome:\n\nHe's happy, friendly, and will help add stability to your IoT vessels, we hope.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/","title":"Meet Rodney"},"https://blog.drogue.io/minikube-roundtrip/":{"body":"Minikube is a convenient tool\nfor developing cloud services on your laptop, but how can you access\nthem from your IoT device?

Gimbals\nA lot of manufactures have started putting gyroscopes into most everything.\nWhen you pair up 3 gyroscopes on each of the 3 real-world axes, you can start to understand how an object pivots around a point.\nWith some advanced processing, these motion processors can keep track of the absolute position (relative to a calibrated start point),\ninstead of just reporting \"turning left for 3 seconds...\"\ni2c\nWhile some of previous experiments worked with USART (serial ports) and SPI (another serial port), our chosen motion processing chip uses the i2c bus, which again is sorta a serial port.\nUnlike SPI, though, where we used a physical signal to select a chip for communications, with i2c, every device on the bus has its own address.\nWithin a transaction, you address bytes to a device, and while the transaction is open, you can read bytes from the device.\nThe content across the i2c bus is pretty device-specific, but there are some commonly-seen conventions.\nRegisters\nA lot of what occurs in the embedded world deals with registers, which are 1-to-4 (or more) bytes of addressable memory.\nMany i2c devices work with the same concept, allowing you to read and write values within registers on the device.\nTo read a an imaginary register (0xAB), which can be addressed by a 1-byte address, and returns a 1-byte value:\n// to hold the response returned\nlet mut response = [0; 1];\n\n// write the address of the register to read, to the device to read from\ni2c.read( device_address, [ 0xAB ], &amp;mut response )\n\nTo write an imaginary register (0xAB), which can be addressed by a 1-byte address, with a 1-byte value (0x42):\ni2c.write( device_address, [ 0xAB, 0x42 ] );\n\nThe device's reference manual should describe the registers and their values.\nAs usual, many registers are bitfields, so you may have to read a register's and toggle specific bits within it before writing it back to the device.\nThe MPU-6050\nThe InvenSense/TDK MPU-6050 is a small motion processor with 3 gyroscopes and matching accelerometers.\nFor this post, we will only be exploring how to make the gyroscopes track movement.\n\nRaw Data\nThe easiest data to retrieve from the MPU-6050 is raw data from the gyroscopes and accelerometers, which is provided in relative terms.\nYou can gain the degrees-per-time or G-forces-per-time for each axis at a given point in time.\nTo consume these values though, you have to do a fair bit of math and bookkeeping on your own.\nDMP Data\nThe MPU-6050 includes a digital motion processor (DMP).\nUltimately, the entire MPU-6050 has its own MCU on-board and runs its own firmware.\nTo take advantage of the DMP, though, you must load, after each power-up, the DMP firmware.\nOur Rust driver helps you out with that.\nThe benefit of using the DMP is that the chip provides for the math and bookkeeping, providing you with a series of quaternions on a FIFO.\nA quaternion involves math significantly beyond my own comprehension, but the bottom line is that they represent an absolute rotation/position of the chip.\nA quaternion is a set of 4 numbers, which uniquely identify how the item is rotated around each of its axes.\nVisualizing\nThe three.js project provides a set of tools for working in three dimensional scenes within the browser.\nEven more importantly, it also works with quaternions.\nIf we can connect the data being pumped from the MPU-6050 to the browser, then the physical motion process can replace two-dimension controls such as a mouse or trackpad.\n\n  \n\nLet's Rust\nSince this is an i2c device, first we have to set up a typical i2c bus, however is appropriate for your board.\nFor my board, after patching the HAL to support i2c3:\nlet scl3 = gpioc.pc0.into_open_drain_output(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.otyper)\n                    .into_af4(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.afrl);\n\nlet sda3 = gpioc.pc1.into_open_drain_output(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.otyper)\n                    .into_af4(&amp;mut gpioc.moder, &amp;mut gpioc.afrl);\n\nlet i2c = I2c::i2c3(device.I2C3, (scl3, sda3), KiloHertz(100), clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb1r1);\n\nNext we create an instance of the MPU-6050 driver attached to that i2c.\nNotice, we're using an embedded-time-based Clock as described in a previous post.\nlet sensor = Mpu6050::new(i2c, Address::default(), &amp;CLOCK).unwrap();\n\nIt can have one of two predetermined i2c addresses, based on if an extra connection is made. \nWe're using the default address.\nWe stuff that into our RTIC shared resources, and pick it up later, in our idle task once the clock is ticking forward.\nUse the Sensor\nSince we want to have to think less about math, we initialize_dmp() to ensure the chip is ready to do our bidding with absolute positioning information:\nlet sensor: &amp;mut Mpu6050&lt;'_, _, _&gt; = ctx.resources.sensor;\nsensor.initialize_dmp().unwrap();\n\nNow, all the important information will be heading towards us through a FIFO, in 28-byte packets.\nYou can drive reading the FIFO from an interrupt if you prefer, but here we're running in a simple loop.\nAs long as there's at least one packet of 28 bytes available, we read it out:\nloop {\n    let len = sensor.get_fifo_count().unwrap();\n    if len &gt;= 28 {\n        let mut buf = [0; 28];\n        let buf = sensor.read_fifo(&amp;mut buf).unwrap();\n         ...\n    }\n}\n\nNow that you have a [u8;28] of bytes, knowing how the packet is constructed is helpful.\nToday, we will use the knowledge that the first 16 bytes are the quaternion in (w, x, y, z) format, 4 bytes for each portion.\nWe can either feed that to the Quaternion::from_bytes(...) to use it on-board, or we can shuffle it straightaway unprocessed to the visualizer.\nWe choose the second option in this case.\n\nTie it all together\nHopefully this post has helped see how we can tie together a bag of disparate drivers, protocols, technologies and languages\ninto a single functioning system.\nThe crate to accomplish all of this from the embedded side is drogue-mpu-6050 and it is available on crates.io.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/mpu-6050/","title":"Motion & MPU-6050"},"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/":{"body":"Routinely we have to deal with recognizing patterns within text or byte streams. \nWhile LL(k) and LALR are common types of parsers, the nom crate brings parser combinators to the embedded Rust world.\nParser Combinators\nAs their name implies, parser combinators are things that can parse inputs, and can be combined to parse even more complex input.\nSimilar to LL(k) type of parsing, small atoms are built up into larger, more capable parsing.\nWhy we parse\nSo far we've implemented two drivers for WiFi-offloading boards. \nBoth of these boards used some variant of Hayes AT commands in order to communicate with your primary device.\nFor instance, when joining a WiFi access point, the eS-WiFi board might reply one of two ways:\nIf successful:\n[JOIN ] myssid,192.168.2.18,0,0\nOK\n&gt;

 prompt, we can write a pretty quick parser:\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"[JOIN   ] \") &gt;&gt;\n        ssid: take_until!(\",\") &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        ip: take_until!(\",\") &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        tag!(\"0,0\") &gt;&gt;\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        ok &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            JoinResponse::Ok\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nNotice we don't have to specifically match many bits. \nWe look for the [JOIN   ]  blob, and then match everything until the first comma as the SSID. \nWe consume that comma, and everything until the next comma is the assigned IP address.\nThen you notice, we are using the ok parser we already created, to match the OK\\r\\n.\nWe've chosen to not match the prompt just yet.\nThe other response, the error case, we can write a very loose parser to match:\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_error&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        take_until!( \"ERROR\" ) &gt;&gt;\n        error &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            JoinResponse::JoinError\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nBasically, we decide to ignore most everything, and match using our error rule above.\nOf course, that join_error parse rule is pretty ambiguous, but we'll solve that shortly.\nCombining parsers\nWith nom you create your rules, and then you pick one, and attempt to parse a slice of bytes.\nIt either successfully parses, returning a result along with any remainder slice of unparsed bytes,\nor it returns an error, indicating all bytes remain unparsed.\nWhile we're combined the ok and error parsers into the join and join_error parsers,\nwe need some way to glue those two together as another higher-order parser.\nThankfully, nom gives us the alt!(..) macro to do just that. \nAs long as your rules return the same type of result (both are JoinResponse in our case),\nthey can be alt!'d together.\nA first attempt might look like:\nWarning, will not work as you might hope\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_response&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        response:\n        alt!(\n              join\n            | join_error\n        ) &gt;&gt;\n        prompt &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            response\n        )\n\n    )\n);\n\nFirst, before we address why it doesn't work, let's deconstruct it a bit.\nEvery response starts with a \\r\\n sequence, which we did not put in either rule, so we match it regardless on our aggregate rule.\nThen we pick with join or join_error and assign it to the response variable.\nThen we finally match the always trailing prompt and return the matches response.\nWhy doesn't this work?\nBecause nom allows for streaming parsing, knowing that maybe it didn't completely parse something this time, but once you add a few more bytes, maybe it'll match next time.\nGiven the definition of join, we match a given prefix up to a comma.\nIn the error case, the comma is not present. \nYou might think that'd force it to attempt the second option of join_error which requires no comma, but nom is an optimist. \nParsing of join did not fail, it just hadn't yet succeeded.\nGiven the way we use the parser, though, we know in our case there are no additional bytes to be expected.\nWhat you've got is all there is, so let's let nom know that by wrapping the rules with complete!(...).\nThis signals that a rule that has not yet succeeded should be considered a failure, and for nom to continue evaluating other alternatives.\nnamed!(\n    pub(crate) join_response&lt;JoinResponse&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        tag!(\"\\r\\n\") &gt;&gt;\n        response:\n        alt!(\n              complete!(join)\n            | complete!(join_error)\n        ) &gt;&gt;\n        prompt &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            response\n        )\n\n    )\n);\n\nNow, all we have to do is use the parser, and we'll get back the result we're hoping for:\nlet parse_result = parser::join_response(&amp;bytes);\n\nmatch parse_result {\n    Ok((_remainder, response)) =&gt; {\n        match response {\n            JoinResponse::Ok =&gt; {\n                // yay!\n            }\n            JoinResponse::JoinError =&gt; {\n                // bad password or ssid or such\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    Err(_) =&gt; {\n        // something went woefully wrong during parsing\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case, we know the slice we parsed was complete, so we can ignore the _remainder since it should, in theory, be empty.\nMore complex\nWe've also published an uber-tiny drogue-nom-utils crate to provide helper and utility parsers that we have used more than once.\nSome of these adapters will transmit a response like the following to indicate a certain amount of data is available for a certain connection:\n+IPD,&lt;link_id&gt;,&lt;length&gt;\n\nThe length portion is simply the characters that make up the length, such as 1024; a 1 followed by a 0 followed by a 2 and a 4. \nSo we need to parse that as an actual numeric type, not an array of 4 number-looking ASCII characters.\nThe conversion of ASCII to numbers is usually easy, unless you're no_std so we have our own atoi_usize to do that for usize-sized numbers.\nTo make a parser combinator that can parse a sequence of ASCII digits and return a single usize, we write a function in the style of nom:\npub fn parse_usize(input: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;[u8], usize&gt; {\n    let (input, digits) = digit1(input)?;\n    let num = atoi_usize(digits).unwrap();\n    IResult::Ok((input, num))\n}\n\nWhich can then be used like:\nnamed!(\n    pub data_available&lt;Response&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        opt!( crlf ) &gt;&gt;\n        tag!( \"+IPD,\") &gt;&gt;\n        link_id: parse_usize &gt;&gt;\n        char!(',') &gt;&gt;\n        len: parse_usize &gt;&gt;\n        crlf &gt;&gt;\n        (\n            Response::DataAvailable {link_id, len }\n        )\n    )\n);\n\nOne nice thing about nom is that you can feed data forward within a do_parse!, using the result of parse_usize in another macro such as take!(len).\nCombinators in the tin\nWhile we write our own domain-specific combinators, nom ships with a vast array of useful ones beyond the tag!, alt! and complete! that we've seen. \nEach of these macros can also be replaced with function calls if you have some fancy logic you want to involve in your parsing.\nA short (and incomplete) list of the combinators we've found useful:\n\nalt!: Try a list of parsers and return the result of the first successful one\nchar!: matches one character: `char!(char) =&gt; &amp;u8 -&gt; IResult&lt;&amp;u8, char&gt;\ncomplete!: replaces a Incomplete returned by the child parser with an Error\ndo_parse!: \tapplies sub parsers in a sequence. it can store intermediary results and make them available for later parsers\nopt!: make the underlying parser optional\ntag!: declares a byte array as a suite to recognize\ntake!: generates a parser consuming the specified number of bytes\n\nSupports no_std\nNom works fantastically well, even in a no_std environment. \nYou can't use the regexp combinators without std, but even if you did use regexps, then you'd have two problems.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/","title":"Nom Parser"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/":{"body":"async/await within Rust is a convenient way to gain parallelism,\neven on an embedded device where we ostensibly have exactly one userland\nthread by default.\nThreads and async/await\nFirst, threads...\nWhile living the larger laptop/server CPU lifestyle, we've grown acustomed\nto having threads. Lots of threads. Each thread generally provides the illusion\nof a straight-line execution of code that owns the entire processor. \nAs some books describe it, from the thread's point-of-view, the whole processor\nis theirs, just sometimes (while other threads are running), it's just a very\nslow processor.\nTo accomplish this magic of appearing to own the entire processor, threads\nalso have to actually give each thread it's own space for it's stack \nto grow. Additionally, the kernel has to occasionally freeze one thread, swap\nout that thread's stack for another waiting thread's, and then unfreeze the other \nthread to run for a bit. This is context switching.\nThe same thing happens when running multiple processes instead of just threads,\nbut then the heap and the memory-manager gets involved, so that each process has\nits own supposedly unlimited memory address space.\nThis is all great (aside from race conditions), but also quite heavy for achieving\nparallelism on a small $2 MCU that is already running its tail off to blink some LEDs\nin a timely manner.\nNow, async...\nWith Rust (and several other languages), there's the idea of async and await,\nwhich ultimately represent a way to deal with cooperative multi-tasking, instead\nof preemptive as defined by modern threads and processes.\nTo live the async lifestyle with Rust, you first must mark your function or method as\nasync. Unfortunately, you can now no longer call this method from code that isn't \nalso async. And simply marking your function as async really accomplishes very little.\nBut once you're in an async context (getting into one, we'll address shortly), you can \ncall other async functions, and here's where the magic happens. Calling an async function \nwill not return the result you're asking for. Great? Great! Instead, it signals you'd like \nthat function to go off, and do whatever it needs to do, and you'll check back later when \nyou need to know the answer.\nasync fn foo() {\n  let not_the_result = bar();\n  // bar is possibly chugging away doing work, maybe, kinda\n\n  ... lots of other stuff ...\n\n  // NOW we care if bar() has completed, and will do nothing\n  // else until it does.\n  let actually_the_result = not_the_result.await;\n}\n\nUltimately, an async function returns a future that will, from your caller's\npoint-of-view, block when you .await until it's satisfied. \nThe awesomeness: it's not really blocking, in terms of blocking the single MCU\nprocessor from doing other stuff. Which is where the real power lies.\nIs it async turtles all the way down?\nAs noted above, you can only call an async function from within an already async context.\nHow do you get into an async context to start? \nExecutors\nAn executor is a bit of code that can take an async block as an argument, and spawn it\ninto an async context where the magic can then happen. The Rust ecosystem has a few executors,\nand the embedded Rust ecosystem has a few also. The executor API is pretty much left to the\nimplementation, so read the docs of whichever you choose.\nWhy is this good for embedded?\nWe generally have a single core, underpowered little processor without a memory-management\nunit. We also prefer to statically allocate as much as we can, without over-allocating\nmemory \"just in case\" because sometimes we're only rocking 48kb to play with. While\nyou can certainly implement preemptive threading on an MCU, you would then have to estimate\nand reserve stack space per thread, possibly over/under-allocating.\nWith some strategies, you can precisely allocate memory with async tasks and deterministically\nknow you won't inadvertantly OOM. If you spawn new tasks willy-nilly, then of course you can\nstill exhaust your executor's memory pool, but that can be controllable and isolated to\njust the executor, not corrupting your entire memory space.\nLet's see an example\nI have some proof-of-concept code deep within a secure arctic bunker that I hope to clean up \nand publish shortly, but here's an example of... what else... blinky, using async and await.\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    rtt_init_print!();\n    log::set_logger(&amp;LOGGER).unwrap();\n    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Debug);\n\n    let mut device = Peripherals::take().unwrap();\n\n    log::info!(\"initializing\");\n    let mut flash = device.FLASH.constrain();\n    let mut rcc = device.RCC.constrain();\n    let mut pwr = device.PWR.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb1r1);\n    let clocks = rcc\n        .cfgr\n        .sysclk(80.mhz())\n        .pclk1(80.mhz())\n        .pclk2(80.mhz())\n        .freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr, &amp;mut pwr);\n\n    init_executor!( 1024 );\n\n    // NOTE: This is *not* the HAL Timer\n    let mut tim15 = crate::timer::Timer::tim15(device.TIM15, clocks, &amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\n    // NOTE: Since this is *not* the HAL timer, I have to color\n    //       outside the lines to enable/reset the apb2\n    unsafe {\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2enr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15en().set_bit());\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2rstr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15rst().set_bit());\n        (&amp;(*RCC::ptr()).apb2rstr).modify(|_,w| w.tim15rst().clear_bit());\n    }\n\n    AsyncTimer::initialize(tim15);\n\n    let mut gpioa = device.GPIOA.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut ld1 = gpioa\n        .pa5\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpioa.moder, &amp;mut gpioa.otyper);\n\n    spawn(\"ld1\", async move {\n        loop {\n            ld1.set_high().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(1000u32)).await;\n            ld1.set_low().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(1000u32)).await;\n        }\n    });\n\n    let mut gpiob = device.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.ahb2);\n    let mut ld2 = gpiob\n        .pb14\n        .into_push_pull_output(&amp;mut gpiob.moder, &amp;mut gpiob.otyper);\n\n    spawn(\"ld2\", async move {\n        loop {\n            ld2.set_high().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(500u32)).await;\n            ld2.set_low().unwrap();\n            AsyncTimer::delay(Milliseconds(500u32)).await;\n        }\n    });\n\n    executor::run_forever();\n}\nWhat's it do?\nIt blinks two LEDs. One is on/off every second, the other is on/off every half second.\nThe two calls to spawn are using my executor to start two async contexts. They don't\ndo a dang thing until executor::run_forever() is called, which starts both.\nIf we view them as two independent tasks, they first turn on their LED. Then they\ncall an async function named delay(...) with the amount of time they want to wait.\nThat call itself will return a future immediately, which is a pretty poor delay.\nBut once we .await on that future, from each task's point-of-view, it's a blocking\ncall for 1000 (or 500) milliseconds.\nOnce the .await is satisfied, the task can carry on, toggling it's LED and doing\nthe delay(...) dance again.\nSince the .await does not actually block the entire processor though, it allows\nthe other task to keep churning, itself doing real work or possibly .awaiting.\n\n  \n\nHow's it different from a non-async delay?\nFirst, this delay supports many individual delays using a single hardware timer.\nAdditionally, the normal Embedded HAL CountDown timers may use the nb non-blocking\ncrate, but they ultimately block when you wish to delay.\nWhen you have bit of code spinning in a loop checking to see if its delay has expired,\nyou're preventing other code from doing real work. You're also actively using the\nprocessor, which may prevent some low-power modes. If you have a low-power timer\navailable to you, there's a high chance that your MCU could go to sleep for 499 milliseconds,\nwake up to flip an LED, and then go back to sleep.\nConclusion\nOf course, you can write code that blinks two LEDs using interrupts and shared \nresources, but at least to my eye, having self-contained tasks with ostensibly\nstraight-line logic is easier to think about.\nIn this implementation, I've glossed over a few facts. First, there is an \ninterrupt-handler (for TIM15) wired up in order for the shared AsyncTimer\nto know when some deadline has expired. Additionally, the executor I'm using\ncurrently supports exactly 8 tasks, and I've initialized it with 1kb of memory\nfor storing the async continuation structures that Rust creates behind the\nscenes. \nAlso, if you want to create something that is asynchronous, you take on the\nsynchronization burden and end up writing implementations of Future which,\nwhile being straight-forward, is also non-trivial.  Using existing async \nfunctionality is much easier.\nAnother minor point is that async functions you've called generally won't actually\nattempt to make progress (in most cases) until you call .await. In the\ncase of our AsyncDelay though, that's not completely true. Calling delay(...)\nregisters a deadline, so it is \"working\" towards it.\nBut in general, I find async embedded code to show much promise, and could\nultimately form the basis for a reactive or actor-like framework for your small\nboards.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/","title":"Rust and Async (on embedded devices)"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-microbit/":{"body":"The BBC micro:bit is a popular development kit often used to teach kids how fun programming can be. Lets see how we can hook it up to the cloud!\n\nVersion 1.x of the kit features a nRF51822 micro-controller, a motion sensor, accelerometer, and a 5x5 LED matrix. The recently released v2.0 upgrades the micro-controller to an nRF52833, which gives twice the flash and the RAM in addition to a speaker and microphone.\nIn this post, you will see how to get started using Rust on the micro:bit. We'll expose the on-chip thermometer as a Bluetooth Environment Sensing Service, and write a small application (in rust, duh), that polls the sensor for data and publishes it to the Drogue Cloud via a Bluetooth gateway.\nThe micro:bit does not have a lot of RAM (only 16k!), so we won't be doing any fancy encryption just yet.\n\nThe micro-controller\nThe nRF family of microcontrollers are generally built for 2.4 GHz low power radio, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee/802.15.4 and some proprietary protocols.\nUnlike some other BLE chips, the nRF 51 and 52 families used in the micro:bit runs the BLE stack alongside the application code in different parts of memory. Nordic Semiconductor (the company making the nRF) provides a proprietary firmware with the BLE implementation that you can use. However, you are also free to use that memory for something else, or provide your own BLE stack (and that is what we will do in this blog post). The advantage of this design is power saving since there is less active circuitry needed to operate the microcontroller. THe disadvantage is that you have to deal with flashing the BLE firmware as well and have to use an in-memory interface for communicating with the BLE controller.\nBluetooth Low Energy is a wireless network technology aimed at low-power applications. The advantage is that devices can operate on coin cell batteries for a long time while still providing some functionality. The BLE standard is huge, and is a bit special in that it covers a lot of what one would consider the 'application layer' standards such as standard formats for thermometers, heart rate monitors, audio and more. The advantage is that BLE-compatible software can work with BLE-compatible hardware from multiple vendors.\nRust and BLE\nFor BLE on nRF using Rust, there are two options:\n\nUse the rust bindings for the nRF firmware.\nThe rubble project, which is an open source pure rust implementation of the BLE standard. It's important to note that the rubble stack has not gone through the Bluetooth Qualification Process, so you cannot make bluetooth-based products with it at present.\n\nIn this post, we'll use rubble, because open source is the one true way.\nConnecting to the cloud\nTo connect BLE devices to the cloud, some sort of gateway software is needed. There are alternatives like Eclipse Kura that provides a lot of functionality.\nWe'll use a proof of concept drogue-bluetooth-gateway, which should work out of the box on most Linux distributions. The idea is that this can run on a gateway device like Raspberry PI and forward data to the cloud. The gateway talks to the bluetooth daemon (BlueZ) using DBus, and needs to run as a priviledged container.\nTo deploy the cloud, have a look at drogue-cloud which you can run locally on minikube.\nThe code\nThe example used in this blog post can be found at the drogue-microbit repository. This repository contains some libraries and example applications for the micro:bit based on the nrf-hal. An alternative crate to use is the microbit crate, which re-exports on nrf-hal + some libraries.\nThe example uses RTIC, which provides a useful abstraction for writing embedded rust application.\nConfiguring the BLE stack\nRubble needs to be configured with:\n\nAn implementation of a Transmitter trait. Rubble comes with a BleRadio type that consumes the radio device as well as TX/RX packet buffers.\nA timer that is used to drive the link layer state. The micro:bit features a timer that we can use for this purpose.\nA set of buffers and queues which is used to pass data between the radio, link layer and attribute protocol.\nA BLE channel mapper that exposes attributes that map to the GATT service we're implementing.\n\npub enum AppConfig {}\nimpl Config for AppConfig {\n    type Timer = BleTimer&lt;hal::pac::TIMER0&gt;;\n    type Transmitter = BleRadio;\n    type ChannelMapper = BleChannelMap&lt;EnvironmentSensingService, NoSecurity&gt;;\n    type PacketQueue = &amp;'static mut SimpleQueue;\n}\n\nThe BLE service that most closely matches our use case is the Environment Sensing Service, so we'll use that. It allows exposing different types of environment data such as temperature, humiditiy along with some metadata. In theory, an application relying on this standard can be interoperable with any device implementing this service.\nlet ess: EnvironmentSensingService = EnvironmentSensingService::new();\n\nlet ble_r = Responder::new(tx, rx, L2CAPState::new(BleChannelMap::with_attributes(ess)));\n\nIn order for a BLE device to be known to the world, it must advertise its existence. It does so by broadcasting advertisements, so that those interested can discover it. The broadcast is done at regular intervals, usually called the advertisement interval. In the example application it's set to 100 milliseconds, which makes it pretty easy to discover. The advertisement also contains some metadata about the broadcaster, in our case a name of the device along with the UUIDs corresponding to the service that the device supports.\nlet next_update = ble_ll.start_advertise(\n        Duration::from_millis(100),\n        &amp;[\n            AdStructure::CompleteLocalName(\"Drogue IoT micro:bit\"),\n            AdStructure::ServiceUuids16(ServiceUuids::from_uuids(true, &amp;[ESS_UUID])),\n        ],\n        &amp;mut radio,\n        tx_cons,\n        rx_prod,\n    )\n    .unwrap();\nble_ll.timer().configure_interrupt(next_update);\n\nRubble needs to act on RADIO interrupts to handle received data.\n#[task(binds = RADIO, resources = [radio, ble_ll], spawn = [ble_worker], priority = 3)]\nfn radio(ctx: radio::Context) {\n    ...\n}\n\nIt also requires to ensure that connection events can be processed at regular intervals.\n#[task(binds = TIMER0, resources = [radio, ble_ll], spawn = [ble_worker], priority = 3)]\nfn timer0(ctx: timer0::Context) {\n    ...\n}\n\nBoth of these spawn another task which does all the work:\nwhile ble_r.has_work() {\n    ble_r.process_one().unwrap();\n}\n\nThis can in theory run in the idle loop as well, but this way it is only run when needed (via radio or timer interrupts).\nMeasuring the temperature\nTo avoid conflict with the RADIO and TIMER0 interrupts, a Real Time Counter (RTC) is used to periodically measure the temperature\nand update the temperature state of the environment sensing service. The temperature is measured by first starting the measurement, then waiting for a while to\nmake sure the value is stable, then reading the value and stopping the measurement.\n#[task(binds = RTC0, resources = [rtc, thermometer, timer_count, ble_r], priority = 1)]\nfn rtc0(ctx: rtc0::Context) {\n\n    ...\n\n    if *timer_count % 2 == 0 {\n        thermometer.start_measurement();\n    } else {\n        let value = thermometer.read();\n        value.map_or_else(\n        |_| {},\n        |value| {\n                // Our calibration shows that it is off by 4 degrees...\n                let f = value.to_num::&lt;u32&gt;() - 4;\n                ble_r.lock(|ble_r| {\n                    let l2cap = &amp;mut *(ble_r.l2cap());\n                    let provider: &amp;mut EnvironmentSensingService =\n                        l2cap.channel_mapper().attribute_provider();\n                    provider.set_temperature(f);\n                });\n            },\n        );\n        thermometer.stop_measurement();\n    }\n}\nRunning the application\nIf you've connected the micro:bit to your PC, you can flash your device using cargo embed --release. This will start up a console printing log messages from the firmware:\n\nConnecting and reading the data\nTo run the gateway, you need to have podman or docker installed. You can run the gateway using a prebuilt container image:\ndocker run --privileged --volume /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket --net=host -e RUST_LOG=info -e DROGUE_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://http-endpoint.drogue-iot.172.18.0.2.nip.io:30394 -e DROGUE_USERNAME=ble_gw -e DROGUE_PASSWORD=foobar -e BLUETOOTH_DEVICE=B9:64:39:0E:8E:DF -ti quay.io/lulf/drogue-bluetooth-gateway:latest\n\nYou can find the address in the console output from the device. The gateway should be able to connect to your device and publish data to the cloud:\n\nIf the gateway is able to connect to your device, we can see some output in the drogue console:\n\nAnd thats it! \nWhats next\nWe've seen how you can develop open source BLE applications in rust on the BBC micro:bit and sending telemetry data to the cloud via a BLE gateway. However, we have only scratched the surface of what you can do with it There are more interesting sensors on the micro:bit to play with, like the motion sensor and the mic/speaker on the v2.\nThe rubble stack is not completely reliable, and difficulties connecting to the device and disconnects does occur. Working out the root cause for these issues would improve the relability of the example.\nThere are several alternatives to use as BLE gateways, such as Eclipse Kura that it could be interesting to try. It would also be nice to have support for 6LoWPAN in rubble, so that BLE devices can be directly connected using IPv6.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-microbit/","title":"Rust on the BBC micro:bit"},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/":{"body":"As noted in the first post, I'm working towards doing more IoT using Rust\nin an embedded ARM Cortex-M world.  Thankfully, the Rust compiler leverages\nLLVM and can target quite a few different processors. \nInstruction Sets &amp; Processors\nThat being said, there are quite a few different processors even within the \nCortex-M family.  They all have mostly similar instruction sets, which makes \nthe generation of the executable pretty straightforward (for the compiler).\nBut each processor contains different amounts of flash memory (where the \nprogram is stored) and different amounts of RAM (used during the execution\nof the program).\nThe ARM processors are different than you might have experienced with the\nIntel and AMD processors, because ARM is licensed intellectual property\nwhere a multitude of manufacturers can create their own processor, mostly\nfollowing ARM's specifications. \nPeripherals\nOne of the largest sources of variety is in the peripherals within the\nprocessor. With desktop machines, we think of peripherals as \"a display\"\nor \"an external harddrive\" or \"a mouse\". Within an embedded processor,\na perhipheral is lower-level, embodying things like timers and SPI busses\nand serial port thingies.\nEach of these peripherals is interacted with by code through one or more\nregisters, which is a byte (or two or four) of memory within the processor.\nThese registers get memory mapped into the normal RAM-addressable memory\nthat code can operate upon.\nFor instance, within the STM32F401 processor from STMicroelectronics,\nthere are a few registers for configuring and interacting with the USART\n(a \"serial port\"). Some bits of the registers control the baud rate, stop-bits,\nand parity of the underlying serial bus. Other registers are used to transfer\noctets from your code to the serial bus and to receive octets from the serial bus\ninto your code. Additional registers are used to communicate if errors have \noccurred while attempting to move data across (overruns, parity errors, noise).\nThe reference manuals for processors describe the memory location and semantics\nof each bit/byte of each register for each peripheral. \n\nWorking with memory addresses and bitwise manipulation of these registers\nwould be... challenging.\nPeripheral Access Crates (PAC)\nThankfully, some producers of ARM Cortex-M chips also ship a related XML file\ncalled an SVD (System View Descriptor). These files take the prose information\nfrom the reference manuals and makes it machine-readable. Tooling in the Rust\ncommunity, called svd2rust can consume\nthese files and produce Rust code so we can use friendly name to manipulate registers.\nThe result of using svd2rust is what's called a peripheral access crate, or PAC.\nOne example is the stm32f4 crate.\nOnce you have a PAC, you can at least write slightly better-looking code, but\nyou are still thinking in terms of registers, bits and bytes. A PAC doesn't quite\nget you up to the semantics of a serial port thingy.\nHardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)\nWhile different silicon manufacturers produce similar but different ARM Cortex-M\nchips, using possibly different registers to accomplish things, at the end of the day,\nmany still have serial port thingies (e.g. a USART).\nTo begin to bring commonality across the chips, there's a hardware abstraction layer (HAL).\nThe HAL is created in two parts. First is the common embedded-hal\nwhich defines abstractions such as how to read or write to a serial port.\nNote, it does not define an abstraction for serial port itself, since the configuration\nand setup of a serial port is still quite chip-specific. But assuming you've configured\na port, embedded-hal gives us a common way to read octets or write octets (or words,\nor whatever size data the specific port supports).\nThe embedded-hal is purely a crate of Rust traits, and by itself is not functional.\nHumans create a HAL implementation for a specific bit of silicon using the\ngenerated PAC in order to provide a friendly way of interacting with different chips.\nFor instance, there's the stm32f4xx-hal\nHAL crate which has been lovingly hand-crafted, using the stm32f PAC\nin order to safely configure and use a chip from the STM32F4 family of silicon.\nThe HAL includes plenty of bits that don't map to the embedded-hal traits, because\nactivities such as setting up the serial port thingy is outside of scope for embedded-hal,\nbut it also does mix in the embedded-hal traits where the functionality overlaps.\nSafety\nOne benefit Rust HALs have over other HALs based on other languages is the safety\nthat can be provided using zero cost abstractions.\nTake, for instance, on the STM32F401 chip, one of the serial port thingies (USART6) \ncan be connected to a couple of different sets of pins. Since each chip tends to ultimately\nhave more peripherals than can be surfaced through physical pins, a lot of pins can\nperform one of several functions. \nIn the case of USART6, the transmission line can be attached to pin PA11 or PC6.\nPC6 could alternatively be configured for usage with i2c or SDIO. Until you\nexplicitly configure the pin for usage as the USART6 transmission line, the HAL\nwill not allow you to use it to further configure the USART6 serial port thingy.\nIn my case, I've wired up my serial port device to pins PA11 for transmission (tx)\nand PA12 for receiving (rx).\nFirst I get the HAL representation of the GPIO pins, the little bits of metal sticking\nout of my board:\nlet gpioa = device.GPIOA.split();\n\nThen I select off the two pins I need for my USART:\nlet pa11 = gpioa.pa11;\nlet pa12 = gpioa.pa12;\n\nAt this point, pa11 and pa12 are of type PA11&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;&gt; and\nPA12&lt;Input&lt;Floating&gt;&gt; respectively. Two floating digital input pins is\nnot sufficient for usage as a serial point. In their initial natural state,\nI could use them to sense voltage changes, as digital inputs, but I cannot\nharness the internal USART peripheral that may be attached to them.\nSo next, I configure the processor to know I specifically want to use them for USART6 \ninstead of any of the other usages they could have. The into_alternative_af8() is \nhow I tell the processor (through the PAC) that I intend to use them as USART6:\nlet tx_pin = pa11.into_alternate_af8();\nlet rx_pin = pa12.into_alternate_af8();\n\nBehind the scenes, the HAL is using the PAC to twiddle the appropriate bits\nin the appropriate registers to configure the pointy bits of metal sticking\nout of the board and what the processor thinks I intend to do with them.\nNow, the types of tx_pin and rx_pin are PA11&lt;Alternate&lt;AF8&gt;&gt; and\n&lt;PA12&lt;Alternate&lt;AF8&gt;&gt; respectively. I can't use them a simple digital I/O\npins now, because Rust has consumed the generic pins and returned me USART-configured\npins.\nI can finally use the HAL method to configure my serial port thingy:\nlet mut serial = Serial::usart6(\n            usart6,\n            (tx_pin, rx_pin),\n            ... \n            ...);\n\nThe usart6(...) function will only accept appropriate configured pins which\nare usable as USART6. The compiler will not let me use arbitrary pins, or even\ncorrect pins that haven't been fully configured.\nNow, though, our serial implements the Read&lt;...&gt; and Write&lt;...&gt; traits\nfrom embedded-hal and can be handed off to an actual device driver that\nis written purely from the point-of-view of embedded-hal. \nThe device driver doesn't need to know which vendor's silicon I'm using, just that\nthere's now an object that can be written to and read from.\nFinally...\nEmbedded coding is hard, especially when you're not stupendously experienced doing it.\nOn the other hand, using Rust provides a nice set of abstractions and a ton of guardrails\nto prevent you from flying off the cliff of correct code.\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/","title":"Rust Embedded Layer Cake"},"https://blog.drogue.io/the-cloud-side-of-things/":{"body":"Up until now, we have focused on \"Rust on embedded devices\", at least when it comes to writing blog posts. Let's\nchange that.\n\nWe already had posts about WiFi Offloading using the ESP,\nEmbedded TLS with Rust, and Integrating the es-WiFi over SPI.\nHowever, what good is an embedded HTTP client for, if you have nowhere\nto send your data.\nGetting started\nPushing a simple sensor value to a database is simple. Today, everyone can do that. There are so many examples out there,\nthat show how to use a Raspberry Pi and push some data to a Mosquitto broker. I would argue, that this is nice, and cool,\nbut no IoT.\nMany IoT projects start with a simple PoC. A Raspberry Pi, a bit of script code, some backend process. Off you go!\nThis is great, because in most cases, people just try to build some kind of application. An application which is built\non top of IoT. This may require you to implement some functionality on the device side, and on the backend side.\nWithout really knowing it, you implemented an HTTP server, simply for serving a static web page.\nSuddenly things get complicated\nThen, things tend to get much more complex than anticipated. Adding more devices also increases the number of devices\nyou need to manage. It also increases the number of messages that hit your backend system. At best, you have a system\nthat allows you to scale horizontally. That can buffer data, handle peaks gracefully, and helps you manage a huge number\nof devices.\nHopefully you won't stop with a single application. The next application however might look slightly different. From\nXKCD #927 we learned, that there is always a new standard around the corner. Things,\nespecially industrial things, tend to have a rather long lifespan. So you need to incorporate new protocols, new\ndata formats, and new use cases into your system, in order to keep your things running. And, the more devices you\nconnect, the more sense it makes to interconnect the data.\nThere a more problems to solve, but I don't want to scare you 😉\nWhat we need\nWe need something that allows the developer to focus on the actual use case, and not worry about IoT concerns.\nThis is important to remember in what comes next. Because our focus is not on the simplicity of solving a single\nIoT use case, but to provide a scalable, modular, and interoperable platform that allows you to implement all\ndifferent kinds of IoT use cases.\nKnative &amp; Cloud events\nKnative is a serverless framework for Kubernetes. And please, let's ignore the term\n\"serverless\" for the moment.\nKnative helps you build scalable microservices. If you are using Rust to implement them, a microservice starts up\nin milliseconds and consumes only a few megabytes of RAM. Knative also offers APIs around the use case of events\n(aka messages). Instead of using a messaging protocol like AMQP or MQTT, Knative builds on top of\nCloud Events.\nIn a nutshell, Cloud Events describes transport layers and data formats in order to transport events. For example,\nfor HTTP, that consists of a few HTTP headers, and the HTTP body being the actual payload. But cloud events can also be\nrepresented in different other technologies like HTTP, JSON, Kafka, AMQP, and more. Since there is a common data model,\nit is easy to translate between these different technologies.\nKnative eventing builds on top of that. Using Kubernetes custom resources, you can deploy event sources, sinks, and\nflows, and put translators between the steps. By default, Knative eventing uses the HTTP representation to exchange\nevents between services, but it is possible to use other representations as well. \nAs Knative is \"serverless\", it can easily scale down to zero, but also scale up as needed.\nEndpoints\nIn order to support the idea of being protocol agnostic, we provide different protocol endpoints. For a start we have\nHTTP (in multiple dialects) and MQTT (v3 and v5). The endpoints are rather small processes, and only translate\nbetween their protocol and the cloud events representation.\nThe endpoints are payload agnostic and stateless, they only forward what they receive to the next Knative event sink,\nand so they are pretty easy to implement.\nKafka\nAs there is a Kafka integration with Knative eventing, we are going to use that. The reason for that is simple: First of\nall, Kafka is known to scale well, so it fits our use case. Second, we can integrate with Kafka in two ways, using Knative\nor directly.\nWhenever we can, we try to use the Knative eventing APIs, trying to be interoperable and modular. However, we still\nhave ability to directly interface with Kafka, and leverage solutions that are more Kafka focused.\nAn example\nWe are in the middle of building this, and you can find an early start at\ndrogue-iot/drogue-cloud on GitHub. There isn't that much code, which is\ndue to fact that we are still missing some important functionality. But also, because we are leveraging technology\nthat already exists.\nNevertheless, we are trying to create some end-to-end examples as early as possible. A simple one, publishing a\ntemperature value, that ends up in a Grafana dashboard. A classic!\n\nWhen you take a look at this, please keep in mind what I wrote earlier: we are not trying to make this single,\ntrivial use case as simple as possible. We try to provide a more versatile solution, that lets you focus on\nimplementing a solution on top of IoT and that still allows you to scale, extend and adapt in the future.\nThe beauty with the Knative APIs is, that you can easily re-arrange your services. Instead of Kafka as\nchannel and source, you could to with some other implementation. Or directly connect the HTTP endpoint to the\n\"Influx DB pusher\". Or put some conversion in the middle, …\nWhat is next?\nIf you poke around in the repository, you will already find a few other things we are working on. However, I think this\nblog post is already long enough, but I also think the topic deserved a bit of introduction, just to explain what our\nmotivation is, and were we are heading to.\nSee also\n\ndrogue-cloud repository \nKnative\nCloud events\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/the-cloud-side-of-things/","title":"The cloud side of things"},"https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/":{"body":"My recent work has been around Cortex-M embedded development using Rust and RTIC.\nI'm using a handy little development board in the form of the STM Nucleo-F401RE.\nUnfortunately, it's handiness stops as soon as you want to communicate with TCP over WiFi, because it lacks WiFi.\n\nThere also exists another board (using an Xtensa chip) called an ESP8266.\nThe ESP is nice in that it contains a stock firmware that responds to Hayes AT commands (like a modem) and can do networky types of things.\nThen again, the ESP uses Hayes AT commands, which are ASCII-like, across a serial port, which is decidedly less networky feeling from the Rust end of the stick.\nembedded-nal (or Drogue-Network)\nThere exists an unpublished Rust crate called embedded-nal. \nThe \"nal\" stands for \"Network Abstraction Layer\". \nThis crate acts as an API and contains Rust traits that can be backed by implementations.\nConsider it to be akin to the socket-related bits of the POSIX standard.\nBy itself, it does nothing. \nBut with an implementation, higher-level drivers can be written regardless of the underlying networking stack.\nSince embedded-nal is not-yet-published, I've taken a non-agressive fork and published it as the drogue-network crate.\nLet's look at the traits...\nI'm initially only concerned wtih TCP, even though the crate also defines a UDP trait.\n/// This trait is implemented by TCP/IP stacks. You could, for example, have an implementation\n/// which knows how to send AT commands to an ESP8266 WiFi module. You could have another implemenation\n/// which knows how to driver the Rust Standard Library's `std::net` module. Given this trait, you can\n/// write a portable HTTP client which can work with either implementation.\npub trait TcpStack {\n\t/// The type returned when we create a new TCP socket\n\ttype TcpSocket;\n\t/// The type returned when we have an error\n\ttype Error: core::fmt::Debug;\n\n\t/// Open a new TCP socket.

wrapper that allows just that. \nCalling an immutable method on an immutable object is allowed, and internally the method, at runtime gets a\nmutable reference to something that does mutable work.\nWe'll return to that in a moment.\nLet's talk to our board...\nBefore we can implement a TcpStack, we need to be able to just have a conversation with our ESP8266 as it sits connected to our serial USART pins.\nAs we discussed in our last post, this involves some board-specific setup, where we:\n\nget the transmit and receive pins, and convince our F401RE that we want to use them for USART communication.\nget our pins which are connected to the ESP's enable and reset pins, and convince our F401RE that we want to be able to push them high or pull them low.\nuse some of those pins to setup a Serial port for USART6 running at 115,200bps.\nenable notifications for the RXNE (receive register not empty; data is ready for us) interrupt.\nand then split the serial port into 2 halfs: transmit and receive.\n\n// SERIAL pins for USART6\nlet tx_pin = pa11.into_alternate_af8();\nlet rx_pin = pa12.into_alternate_af8();\n\n// enable pin\nlet mut en = gpioc.pc10.into_push_pull_output();\n// reset pin\nlet mut reset = gpioc.pc12.into_push_pull_output();\n\nlet usart6 = device.USART6;\n\nlet mut serial = Serial::usart6(\n    usart6,\n    (tx_pin, rx_pin),\n    Config {\n        baudrate: 115_200.bps(),\n        parity: Parity::ParityNone,\n        stopbits: StopBits::STOP1,\n        ..Default::default()\n    },\n    clocks,\n).unwrap();\n\nserial.listen(nucleo_f401re::hal::serial::Event::Rxne);\nlet (tx, rx) = serial.split();\n\nBut right now all we have is a generic serial port pushing bytes back and forth, without any semantics applied.\nThankfully, we've created an ESP8266 driver, though, which can apply some semantics and gives us an easier-to-use way to interact.\nThe driver crate gives us an initialize(...) free function which consumes both halves of the serial port, along with the enable and reset pins, plus two queues.\nWhy two queues?\nThe ESP communicates over the serial port in 2 ways:\n\ncommand/response\nunsolicited messages\n\nThese responses and messages will be created from within the interrupt handler from bytes that have arrived and been interpreted, but consumed elsewhere.\nUsing a heapless Queue allows us to have lock-free Producer and Consumer to shuffle messages between the contexts.\n\nstatic mut RESPONSE_QUEUE: Queue&lt;Response, U2&gt; = Queue(i::Queue::new());\nstatic mut NOTIFICATION_QUEUE: Queue&lt;Response, U16&gt; = Queue(i::Queue::new());\n\nlet (adapter, ingress) = initialize(\n    tx, rx,\n    &amp;mut en, &amp;mut reset,\n    unsafe { &amp;mut RESPONSE_QUEUE },\n    unsafe { &amp;mut NOTIFICATION_QUEUE },\n).unwrap();\n\nNow we are holding two objects: an adapter which is the user-facing\nclient for interacting with the esp8266 wifi adapter, an an ingress which can be used from interrupt service routines to process inbound bytes.\nWiring up the interrupts\nAs noted above, we're using RTIC. \nRTIC provides a place to do your initialization, and an easy way to wire up interrupt handlers and scheduled tasks, with priorities.\nIt also provides a way to share resources between these different contexts. \nSo at the end of our initializtion process, we stuff the objects into the shared-resources object and return it:\ninit::LateResources {\n    adapter: Some(adapter),\n    ingress,\n}\nIngress bytes\nWhen commands are transmitted (via our client adapter), the ESP8266 will trigger the USART6 interrupt for every byte that gets sent back to us.\nThankfully, our ingress object is designed to accept those bytes, so it's quick to wire it up to the interrupt:\n#[task(binds = USART6, priority = 10, resources = [ingress])]\nfn usart(ctx: usart::Context) {\n    if let Err(b) = ctx.resources.ingress.isr() {\n        info!(\"failed to ingress {}\", b as char);\n    }\n}\n\nWith RTIC, the highest priority task using a resource can use it lock-free, because it can interrupt any other task.\nSo we just call the isr() method on our ingress which reads a byte and adds it to an internal buffer.\nInterrupt service routines should be fast, because they might be called a lot. \nIn this case, for every byte that arrives at potentially 115,200bps.\nProcess bytes\nSince the ingressing of bytes needs to be fast, all it does is put it on a buffer and return. \nBut at some point, we need to digest those bytes and determine if they are meaningful, or if we're still waiting on more.\nFor this digesting, we set up a recurring scheduled task, which we schedule the first time from our initialization,\nand then it infinitely reschedules itself.\nconst DIGEST_DELAY: u32 = 100;\n\n#[task(schedule = [digest], priority = 2, resources = [ingress])]\nfn digest(mut ctx: digest::Context) {\n    ctx.resources.ingress.lock(|ingress| ingress.digest());\n    ctx.schedule.digest(ctx.scheduled + (DIGEST_DELAY * 100_000).cycles())\n        .unwrap();\n}\n\nIt's using the same ingress resource, but at a lower priority than the USART, so when it fires, it could conceivably\nbe interrupted by the USART interrupt. By locking the ingress object, we can disable that interrupt for a moment and\ncall our digest() method.\nThe digest() method attempts to parse the internal buffer, and figures out if it represents a response to a previously-issued command\nor an unsolicited message, and if so, it builds a Response object and puts it on the appropriate Queue using its Producer.\nWhere's the WiFi, bucko?\nYeah, we're still not doing WiFi or sockets, are we? \nLet's do that now.\nIn the idle portion of the app, we can use the adapter and magically transform it into a TcpStack implementation.\nFirst, since we're going to be transforming our adapter into something else, we'll be mutating it. \nSo we have to take() it from the Some(T) that is holding it on the shared resources, which replaces\nit with a None.\nNext we use it directly to connect to our WiFi. Behind the scenes, calling 'join(...) for instance\nwill transmit an AT command, and the response will come back through the USART interrupt and be digested\nby the digest task, seemingly in a multi-threaded sort of way. It's not really multi-threaded, the processor\njust keeps iterrupting our idle code and itself until a response occurs and our idle code is allowed to proceed.\nFinally we can into_network_stack() our adapter, which consumes the adapter and gives us back a \nTcpStack implementation.

Grab a cup of coffee.\nNever write a crypto library\nOne of the primary rules in cryptography is never write your own cryptography.\nThere's a lot of smart people already writing crypto libraries, and also a lot of smart people who are happy to poke holes in your hand-rolled crypto.\nThankfully, ARM has created mbedTLS and donated it to TrustedFirmware.org.\nThat sounds perfect, yeah?\nThe downside of mbedTLS is that it's written in C, and is able to target not only embedded platforms, but also fully POSIX-compliance large host systems,\nwhich means it is highly configurable and not immediately useful to Rust developers.\nRust, C, and FFI\nRust does provide mechanisms for calling into libraries written in C. \nThey are inherently unsafe because Rust, rightly, can't trust a library written in C to understand things like lifetimes and Rust's own memory model.\nSo normally, you find yourself with a -sys crate that simply builds the C library, and then wrap that with a Rust crate that provides better safety and semantics.\nThen there's issues such as \"Rust strings are valid UTF-8 and know their length\" and \"C strings are a sequence of bytes followed by a null\", which complicates matters.\nThe drogue-tls-sys crate\nThe first order of business is simply building the mbedTLS library, appropriately configured for an ARM Cortex-M embedded device which lacks things like filesystems, a real-time clock or printf().\nEverything configurable with mbedTLS is done through a config.h file they ship, defining or undefining a variety of macros which indicate what facilities your platform supports.\nBy telling mbedTLS that our platform doesn't support traditional things like calloc(..)/free(...) or snprintf(...),  mbedTLS gives us a way to register function-pointers to those types of things for our platform.  C function pointers.\nLet's look at calloc(...)\nOnce we configure it, mbedTLS gives us this function:\nint mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free( void * (*calloc_func)( size_t, size_t ),\n                                      void (*free_func)( void * ) );\n\nThis allows us to register functions that behave as calloc(...) and free(...), allocating and freeing memory on the heap.\nBy default, embedded Rust doesn't have a heap.\nYou can install an allocator to give you a heap, but then you also have to install an allocation error handler, which unfortunately is an unstable nightly-only feature of Rust.\nHow do we solve this?\nWe fork alloc-cortex-m, and a bit of the Rust alloc crates into our tree.\nThe only reason we have to fork them is because using them directly triggers rustc into being convinced we have a global allocator and need to install the allocation error handler, which as noted above, is nightly-only.\nAllocation in Rust\nRust does allocation using a Layout which basically embodies the size of memory you request, along with adjustments for accomodate memory alignment for your platform.\nRust also wants the exact same layout passed in when you deallocate memory, unlike C's free(...) which only needs a pointer to the memory, because it put the layout information in a header of the initial allocation.\nHow do we solve that? The same way C does, by not expecting the caller to track the layout information, but by scribbling it into the start of the allocation ourselves, also.\nIf mbedTLS needs 16 bytes allocated, it'll call calloc(1, 16) to ask for 1 chunk of 16 bytes.\nTo that, we add 8 bytes for our book-keeping header, so the allocation will ultimately become 24 bytes. The extra 8 bytes track 2 usize slots for our book-keeping: 1 for the size of the allocation (24 bytes total) and one for the alignment requirements. Since our header takes the first 8 bytes, we return the pointer to the 9th byte, which starts the chunk of 16 bytes requested by the caller of calloc(...).\nbyte |0   |1   |2   |3   |4   |5   |6   |7   |8+\n     |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------------\n use |alloc_size         |alignment          |handed back to caller  \n\nWhen free(...) is called with only a pointer from C code, we back-track 8 bytes, read out the size and alignment values and rebuild our Layout to shuffle on into Rust's allocator's dealloc(...) method.\nThis allows us to avoid any external book-keeping, and just tacking an extra 8 bytes onto the head of each allocation.\nBindgen\nSo far we've glossed over how we actually interface from Rust to C and back.\nThe answer is bindgen, which consumes C header files and produces unsafe Rust bindings to the API. \nSince Rust has no concept of null, but C pointers can certainly be null, each pointer tends to get wrapped in a Option on the Rust side.\nWe can use the extern \"C\" syntax to write a function in Rust that can be called from C with the appropriate calling conventions. \nextern \"C\" fn platform_calloc_f(count: usize, size: usize) -&gt; *mut c_void {\n  // do the Layout and allocation dance described above\n}\n\nBindgen's processing of mbedTLS also provides us a Rust-callable function platform_set_calloc_free(...) exposed by mbedTLS. \nThis is where we finally wire stuff up.\nBut, it's an unsafe function that takes function pointers as arguments, so we have to wrap the invocation of it in an unsafe { ... } block, and wrap our functions in an Option::Some(...):\nunsafe { platform_set_calloc_free(Some(platform_calloc_f), Some(platform_free_f)) };\n\nAnd now we've finally provided mbedTLS the ability to allocate and deallocate some heap-ish memory.\nVariadics\nWhen working with TLS and doing FFI in general, you need to be able to debug what's actually going on, particular in the two weeks you're banging your head on the table trying to figure out how it all works.\nJust like calloc(...) above, mbedTLS allows you to pass in a debug logging function. \nThe problem is that the things the debug logging function prints tend to be constructed using variants of sprintf(...), which is a variadic function, meaning it can take an unlimited number of arguments to populate the formatting string.\nFor instance:\nprintf(\"%s says %s %d times\", bob_str, hi_str, 42);\n\nWould print out \"Bob says Hi 42 times\".\nStable Rust does not support variadics.\nIn our case, the two important methods are snprintf(...) which is a true variadic function, and vsnprintf(...) which is slightly less variadic, in that there's an argument that points to the remainder argument list.\nIt's trivial to write an implementation of snprintf(...) in C that delegates to vsnprintf(...) which can then be implemented, non-variadically, in Rust.\nextern int snprintf(char * restrict str, size_t size, const char * restrict fmt, ...) {\n    va_list ap;\n    int n;\n\n    va_start(ap,fmt);\n    n=vsnprintf(str,size,fmt,ap);\n    va_end(ap);\n\n    return n;\n}\n\nThe va_start(...) macro ultimately populates the ap variable with a pointer to the arguments. \nThe arguments are really viewed as an opaque blob of memory, so you must analyze the printf formatting string to know how to treat the bytes behind that pointer.\nWe've create the drogue-ffi-compat crate to help deal with that memory interpretation.\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn vsnprintf(\n    str: *mut u8,\n    size: usize,\n    format: *const u8,\n    ap: va_list,\n) -&gt; i32 {\n    let mut va_list = VaList::from(ap);\n    // use the Rust VaList now\n}\n\nNow, if you process the printf formatting string and see a %d you know the next argument is an i32 in Rust:\nlet value: i32 = va_list.va_arg::&lt;i32&gt;();\n\nIf it's followed by a %c you know you can safely interpret the following argument as a character:\nlet value: char = va_list.va_arg::&lt;char&gt;();\n\nOf course, things will go woefully wrong if you don't have a printf formatting string to guide you through walking the va_list values.\nThe drogue-ffi-compat crate thankfully includes Just Enough printf formatting string processing to debug mbedTLS.\nJust like registering our calloc() and free() implementation with mbedTLS, we can now register our snprintf() and vsnprintf() implementations the same way, using similar functions (not pictured, because yeesh, this is getting long).\nThe drogue-tls crate\nThe drogue-tls crate handily wraps up all the machinations above into a safe and more semantic API for dealing with TLS.\nIt provides an associated function to initialize the system and it sets up the debug logging, etc, and then provides a TcpStack for doing network operations.\nThat's a lot of yaks. Let's TLS.\nRemember, we're doing this so we can put TLS on top of our TCP/IP connections.\nIf you recall from a previous blogpost, we have created a TCP stack based on using an ESP8266 over our USART. \nWe're still doing that. \nBut now we'll initialize the TLS platform and wrap it around that network stack to give us a secure network stack.\nFirst, we initialize, providing a 48kb blob of memory for the heap-ish allocation.\nWe also set up a (terrible) entropy source (this needs to be improved) and see the random-number-generator (RNG):\nlet mut ssl_platform = SslPlatform::setup(\n    cortex_m_rt::heap_start() as usize,\n    1024 * 48).unwrap();\n\nssl_platform.entropy_context_mut().add_source(StaticEntropySource);\n\nssl_platform.seed_rng().unwrap();\n\nOnce our previously-described underlying network stack is fired up and ready to rock, we can borrow it and build ourselves a secure network stack:\nlet mut ssl_config = ssl_platform.new_client_config(Transport::Stream, Preset::Default).unwrap();\nssl_config.authmode(Verify::None);\n\n// consume the config, take a non-mutable ref to the network.\nlet secure_network = SslTcpStack::new(ssl_config, &amp;network);\n\nNote, we haven't enabled verification of authentication on the far end. Normally we would have some root Certificate Authority (CA) keys set up and ensure the far end of the connection is who we think it is.\nWe're skipping that this week.\nOur secure_network also implements TcpStack so we can use it exactly as we used our non-secure stack:\nlet socket = secure_network.open(Mode::Blocking).unwrap();\n\nlet socket_addr = SocketAddr::new(\n    IpAddr::from_str(\"192.168.1.220\").unwrap(),\n    8080,\n);\n\nlet mut socket = secure_network.connect(socket, socket_addr).unwrap();\nlet result = secure_network.write(&amp;mut socket, b\"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nhost:192.168.1.220\\r\\n\\r\\n\").unwrap();\n\nAnd we're secure (roughly) in knowledge that our bytes to and from the far end are travelling over an encrypted connection.\nThat was fun, yeah?\nNext Steps\n\nBetter entropy sources\nCertificate handling and validation for both sides of the conversation.\n\n","id":"https://blog.drogue.io/yak-hole-of-tls/","title":"Down the Yak Hole of TLS"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.drogue.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.drogue.io/digital-twins/":{"body":853,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/esp-programmer/":{"body":493,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/eswifi/":{"body":607,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/first-steps-in-iot/":{"body":661,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/matter-of-time/":{"body":711,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/meet-rodney/":{"body":87,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/minikube-roundtrip/":{"body":407,"title":6},"https://blog.drogue.io/mpu-6050/":{"body":568,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/nom-parser/":{"body":770,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-async/":{"body":795,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-and-microbit/":{"body":792,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/rust-embedded-layer-cake/":{"body":736,"title":4},"https://blog.drogue.io/the-cloud-side-of-things/":{"body":568,"title":3},"https://blog.drogue.io/wifi-offload/":{"body":1144,"title":2},"https://blog.drogue.io/yak-hole-of-tls/":{"body":1027,"title":4}},"length":16},"lang":"English"};
